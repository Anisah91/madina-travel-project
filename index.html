        <h2>Why Madinah?</h2>
        <h3>Madinah: The First Islamic Capital</h3>
        <p>Historically known as Yathrib, Al Madinah was established in the 6th century B.C. It is celebrated as the place where Muhammad established the Muslim community. Al Madinah is steeped in Islamic heritage, and it is home to the Quba Mosque (the first mosque built in Islam) as well as the Prophet’s Mosque, which is considered to be the second-holiest mosque after Makkah’s Grand Mosque.
Yathrib came to prominence centuries ago because of its location; it sits among various trade routes and has unique geographical features, including mountains, plains, oases, and gold, silver and copper mines</p>
<p>The City of Madinah radiates peace and calmness. Visitors often testify that as soon as you enter the city you experience a peaceful feeling that is hard to put into words. The name of the city is also written as Al Madinah Al Munawwarah, which means ‘The Enlightened City.’ It is the capital of the Madinah Province and the fourth most populated city of Saudi Arabia. Being one of the two Holiest cities for Muslims, there are no shortage of holy sites and other places to visit in Madinah.</p></div>
